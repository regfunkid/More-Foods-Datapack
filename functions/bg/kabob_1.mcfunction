# Part of the kabob system. Gives players the next step of "kabob" if they aren't on the last one already.
# It's not... great. If a player eats one, it'll be given in another slot from the one they used (annoying)
# But the alternative is making a new set of functions and advancements if they eat from the offhand--which i'm not doing.
