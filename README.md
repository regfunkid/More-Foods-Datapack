This is the "source code" for Reg's More Foods!

Please please note: if you wish to install Reg's More Foods for yourself, get them from the Modrinth website [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/reg-more-foods/versions). It'll be much easier for you, and all the other versions are hosted there.

The code here is simply for seeing and reading all of it easier. Different versions are visible as seperate branches. The higher the number, the more recent the branch.

### Install Instructions
#### For Release v1.0 and up: 
All you need to do is hit download. Both the Datapack and Resourcepack are included in the .zip, all you have to do is unzip it and put the zips in their respective folders.
#### For the modded versions:
Just hit download. If you're using the Modrinth Launcher, it will automatically install in your selected profile. :)
#### For v1.0-alpha: 
You'll have to open up the version manually and download the two files listed, being the Data Pack and Resource Pack. Clicking the download button directly will only install *one* version--so you have to manually do both. I don't plan on fixing this, nobody plays with it anyway.

### Update Instructions
If this pack is updated and you have an older version, you can simply overwrite it with the newer version. Any items crafted or gained from the previous version will be retained, but their recipes or text may be changed when crafting them again.

### Compatibility
The modded version of this pack automatically works with the AppleSkin mod, so if you have it installed you'll be able to see the updated food values.

Currently, only Fabric and Quilt versions of this pack exist. I don't plan on updating to Forge until they update themselves to 1.20.5 at the very least. Way too much effort trying to update, I don't wanna bother. If anyone else wants to port it for me, I will gladly release it for download here.

Apart from that, no other food datapacks that I know of will work with this one, but other food mods *should* be ok (this pack only affects vanilla items so modded items shouldn't be affected).
